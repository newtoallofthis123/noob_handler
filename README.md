# NoobHandler

A Simple CLI that I wrote to handle my mongoDB database that is linked to various ascepts of my site [noobscience.rocks](https://noobscience.rocks)

You can't really use it since you need my unique `MONGODB_URL`, but you can use it as a template for your own CLI.

I just wanted to make a CLI that I could use to handle my database and since I wanted a nice little executable that I could run from anywhere, I decided to make it in rust.
